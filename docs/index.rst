Sports-betting documentation
************************

Overview
===================
Welcome to the documentation page of my sports-betting project. Here you will find an in-depth description of the classes that I have written to perform various automated tasks such as downloading data from APIs and websites, manipulating that into neccessary/desired formats, and training and saving neural networks models(to name a few) for use in the analysis done in this project.
